# Coach Marty

Coach Marty (BMS) is an companion app that brings Blue Mountain Stateâ€™s legendary coach to your sideline. 
While you play College Football 26, the app captures the on-screen stat displays in real time using OpenCV and OCR. 
It automatically detects your team, tracks performance, and stores stats throughout the game. 
Coach Marty delivers a personalized game debrief at halftime or the final whistle. 
This is generated dynamically with an LLM and voiced through text-to-speech, giving you sharp, hilarious, and brutally honest coaching feedback.
